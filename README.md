# PiHub

PiHub is a Python and Flask based web dashboard designed to run on or work with a Raspberry Pi. The goal of this project is to create a local web application that can monitor Raspberry Pi system information, organize useful tools, and eventually control hardware features such as LEDs, audio visualizers, and automation scripts.

## Project Status

PiHub is currently in early development.

Current focus:

- Setting up the Flask project structure
- Learning Python backend development
- Building the first dashboard page
- Preparing the project for future Raspberry Pi features

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- SQLite, planned
- Raspberry Pi OS, planned

## Planned Features

### Core Dashboard

- System status overview
- CPU usage
- RAM usage
- Disk usage
- System uptime
- Raspberry Pi temperature

### Raspberry Pi Controls

- Reboot command
- Shutdown command
- Restart PiHub service
- View system logs

### Modules

Future PiHub modules may include:

- LED controller
- Audio visualizer
- File manager
- Notes or task manager
- Automation scripts
- Local media controls
- Network tools

### Authentication

A login system may be added later so that only authorized users can access PiHub controls.
